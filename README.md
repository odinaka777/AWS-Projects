# 🏦 Secure Banking App Deployment on AWS

This project demonstrates the full deployment pipeline of a **secure, scalable cloud-based banking application** using **AWS**, **Terraform**, **Jenkins**, **Docker**, and **CI/CD automation**.

## 🚀 Project Overview

As part of a 6-month capstone project under the **Digital Witch Support Community**, I led a cross-functional team to build and deploy a production-grade banking application to AWS. This project showcases end-to-end DevOps implementation with best practices in **Cloud Security**, **Infrastructure as Code**, and **Continuous Delivery**.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Cloud**: AWS (EC2, S3, RDS, IAM, Route 53, VPC, CloudWatch)
- **CI/CD**: Jenkins, GitHub, CodePipeline
- **Containerization**: Docker
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform
- **Security**: IAM roles, security groups, encrypted S3 buckets, least privilege access
- **Monitoring**: CloudWatch, logs and alerts
- **Project Management**: Agile methodology, Notion, Zoom

## 🔐 Key Features

- Fully automated pipeline with GitHub → Jenkins → AWS
- Dockerized backend for scalable deployment
- Secure network architecture using VPC subnets and security groups
- Infrastructure defined and deployed using Terraform
- CI/CD workflows with rollback strategies and build validation
- Encrypted storage, IAM role-based access, and audit logging

## 👨‍💻 Team Role

As **Team Lead**, I was responsible for:

- Designing the AWS architecture
- Creating Terraform scripts for infrastructure provisioning
- Setting up Jenkins pipelines and Docker builds
- Mentoring team members on DevOps tools and cloud practices
- Conducting deployment reviews and troubleshooting sessions

## 📂 Folder Structure


## 📌 Outcome

- Reduced deployment time by **30%**
- Delivered a secure, cloud-native app with CI/CD automation
- Successfully passed mock production audits and performance testing
